# House Price Prediction

Objective

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes. The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Dataset

The dataset contains information on houses, including features like:

Area (square footage)

Number of bedrooms

Location

Year built

Overall condition of the property

Sale price (target variable)

Dataset Details:

Number of records: [Add number of records]

Number of features: [Add number of features]

Missing Values: Addressed during preprocessing

Data Source: [Specify source, e.g., Kaggle, internal]

Ensure you have access to the dataset before running the project.

Requirements

Python Libraries:

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis

numpy: For numerical operations

matplotlib: For data visualization

seaborn: For enhanced visualizations

scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics

Installation:

To install the required libraries, use the following command:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Project Structure

Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the dataset using pandas.

Inspect the dataset structure, column data types, and summary statistics.

Identify missing values, outliers, and potential data quality issues.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values:

Use mean/median for numerical features.

Use mode or create a separate category for missing categorical data.

Remove or cap outliers using statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR).

Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Normalize or standardize numerical features for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze relationships between features and the target variable (Sale Price).

Visualize distributions using histograms and boxplots.

Identify correlations using heatmaps.

Analyze feature importance using feature selection techniques.

Feature Engineering:

Create derived features, such as price per square foot.

Combine or split features where applicable.

Perform dimensionality reduction if required.

Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).

Train the following machine learning models:

Linear Regression: Baseline model

Random Forest Regressor: Non-linear model

Gradient Boosting Regressor: Advanced ensemble model

Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

Model Evaluation:

Use the following metrics to evaluate model performance:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² Score

Compare performance across models.

Visualize actual vs. predicted values.

Results and Insights:

Summarize the best-performing model and its metrics.

Highlight insights from the data and model predictions.

Visualizations:

Visualize feature distributions, target variable trends, and model residuals.

Use scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps for interpretation.

Steps to Run

Clone the repository or download the project files.

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/house-price-prediction.git

Install the required Python libraries.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
